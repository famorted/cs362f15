/*

initilizeGame() takes 15.41% of 584 (90 lines)

unittest1:
	15.75% of 584 lines covered
	2 lines different from initilizeGame()
	Somehow, this is a different of only two lines
	More lines should have been executed since the deck successfully shuffled
	and shuffle() is over two dozen lines with newlines

unittest2:
	17.47% lines covered
	12 lines covered
	This is not bad considering isGameOver() is 26 lines with newlines
