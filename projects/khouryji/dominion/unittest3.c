check everyone elses hands
check if card was played or really discarded
if played, we want to see playedCardCount go up and played Cards hasnt been
  modified except that a new card has been added to the end
//set played card to -1
reduce handcount by 1
int discardCard(int handPos, int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int trashFlag)
{
	
  //if card is not trashed, added to Played pile 
  if (trashFlag < 1)
    {
      //add card to played pile
      state->playedCards[state->playedCardCount] = state->hand[currentPlayer][handPos]; 
      state->playedCardCount++;
    }
	
  //set played card to -1
  state->hand[currentPlayer][handPos] = -1;
	
  //remove card from player's hand
  if ( handPos == (state->handCount[currentPlayer] - 1) ) 	//last card in hand array is played
    {
      //reduce number of cards in hand
      state->handCount[currentPlayer]--;
    }
  else if ( state->handCount[currentPlayer] == 1 ) //only one card in hand
    {
      //reduce number of cards in hand
      state->handCount[currentPlayer]--;
    }
  else 	
    {
      //replace discarded card with last card in hand
      state->hand[currentPlayer][handPos] = state->hand[currentPlayer][ (state->handCount[currentPlayer] - 1)];
      //set last card to -1
      state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer] - 1] = -1;
      //reduce number of cards in hand
      state->handCount[currentPlayer]--;
